Energy Use Intensity - EUI
Energy consumption per unit area of conditioned space (ft2). 
required info: consumption data, conditioned area square footage

units: electrical (kWh)
multiplier: 3.412 kWh -> kBtu
Consumption in kWh is converted to kilo-British Thermal Units (kBtu) and divided by the square footage (ft2) of the conditioned area. 
formula: EUI = (kWh * 3.412) / area(ft2)

units: natural gas (ccf)
multiplier: 102.6 ccf -> kBtu
Consumption in ccf is converted to kilo-British Thermal Units (kBtu) and divided by the square footage (ft2) of the conditioned area.
formula: EUI = (ccf * 102.6) / area(ft2)

units: fuel oil #1 (gal)
multiplier: 139 gal -> kBtu
Consumption in gallons is converted to kilo-British Thermal Units (kBtu) and divided by the square footage (ft2) of the conditioned area.
formula: EUI = (gal * 139) / area(ft2)

units: fuel oil #2 (gal)
multiplier: 138 gal -> kBtu
Consumption in gallons is converted to kilo-British Thermal Units (kBtu) and divided by the square footage (ft2) of the conditioned area.
formula: EUI = (gal * 138) / area(ft2)

special considerations: when calculating the combined EUI of multiple units/buildings you don't sum the individual EUIs, instead use one of the formulas below (more units may be added following the same format)

	multi unit option 1:
	formula: EUI = ((unit1 consumption + unit 2 consumption) * COMMON multiplier ) / (unit1 area + unit2 area)  
	
	multi unit option 2 (area weighted average):
	formula: EUI = (unit1 eui * unit1 area) + (unit2 eui * unit2 area) / (unit1 area + unit2 area)
